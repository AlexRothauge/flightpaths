# Defintion of done
## Ideas
- meaningful unit tests are created
- Written code passes initial unit test 
- Written code passes CI pipeline 
- Written code passes quality gate of chosen linter (maybe % of unit-tests + more metrics if necessary) -> no warnings
- Code Review e.g. at least 2 developer has to review the code before merged.
- code is deployed on Openstack via CI/CD
- acceptance criteria are fullfilled
- (code)-documentation is updated accordingly (where necessary)
- optional non-functional tests have been completed â€“ e.g. performance tests
- optional integration/system test are written  e.g. GUI tests, API tests
